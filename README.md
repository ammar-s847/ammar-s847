Hey, I'm Ammar! I'm a 4th year engineering student at the University of Waterloo with interests spanning Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, and Robotics. Outside of tech, I enjoy lifting, climbing, reading, and guitar.

I know you didn't ask but here are some lessons I've learned throughout my ML engineering journey:

#### MLOps Lessons
* How you ingest, store, transform, and govern data will always be a top priority (Data Platform > ML Platform > Models)
* Having adequate tooling surrounding model development (not inference) can save a lot of headaches later on, especially if you frequently iterate on models or create new ones. Think about what transformation rules, scripts, and configs are shared throughout (ex: experiment tracking, registry, data warehouse, etc)
* Profile your models, kernels, and pipeline to see what components are heavy on latency, memory, CPU, and GPU usage. With this knowledge, you can decide on a scalability model depending on where the bottlenecks lie (ex: model too big for one GPU -> try ZeRO, tensor, or pipeline parallel training)
* Monitor and forward-test your models so you can detect model decay/distribution shift (performance degrades over time on newer data) -->
